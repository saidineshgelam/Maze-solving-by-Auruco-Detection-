# Maze-Solving-By-Auruco-Detection-
The project aims to develop a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for a Turtlebot that can navigate through a maze using Aruco markers as navigation cues. The Turtlebot must move through the maze, detecting Aruco markers placed on the walls and taking appropriate actions based on predefined parameters. Additionally, the robot should identify and report objects (batteries) found in the environment using a logical camera.

The above is the Environment of the project contains Turtlebot which has both Logical and RGB cameras that can detect parts and Auruco markers and navigate through maze according to Aruco data
